# Web-App
This web app provides services for any professor at any university to help them in the process of adding students in their classes. All of us as a student or professor know the struggle of adding students on a waitlist at the first day of the school. Writing down the student’s information such as name and their email address on a paper and later go back to that information and try to email them could be inconvenient. Our web app gives the ability of simply adding the students’ information to our database (such as name, student id, email address, and the class title they want to get an add code for it) and access their information whenever its necessary. The professor or anyone in charge can simply pull up a student’s information among their email address and email them anytime just by clicking on their email address.
